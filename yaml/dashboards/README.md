# Rivian Dashboards

This directory contains the Rivian dashboards that are used to monitor the health and status of the vehicle. They should be mostly copy and paste, but you may need to update the sensor names to match your Home Assistant.

These dashboards require the use of the Rivian custom integration, which can be found by searching for Rivian in HACS, as well as some custom template sensors. The custom template sensors can be found in the `sensors` directory and the `packages` directory.
